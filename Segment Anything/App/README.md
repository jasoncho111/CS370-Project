    To run the app, navigate to Segment\ Anything/App and run in your terminal `shiny run`. Uploaded images must have file extension .tif or .tiff, and they should be 256x256 for the best results. Also, it must be in a format that PIL is capable of reading/opening.<br><br>
    You will need to have a model checkpoint in a folder called SAM_model_cp.<br><br>
